Geo API Vietnam is a package that helps you find locations in Vietnam with strongly cleaned data.

- `province`: Province is spelled correctly.
- `district`: District is spelled correctly.
- `ward`: Ward is spelled correctly.
- `latitude`: Latitude of the location.

- `source`: Origin of `original_address`, including Excel, SQLite, GeoPy, and Google Maps API.
- `original_address`: Address from the above sources.

## How it works

- Use Vietnam location data to clean up and correct typos.
- Use APIs from [GeoPy](https://pypi.org/project/geopy/) and Google Maps ([Google Geocoding](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding)) to search for locations online.

- Search location in smart order: Excel > SQLite > GeoPy > Google Maps.
